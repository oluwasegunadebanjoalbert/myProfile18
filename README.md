About me.

My name Adebanjo Albert,
I am an intermediate front-end developer & a graphic designer, at the moment I can design a website with CMS (like WordPress) I am currently running a Nano-degree course with Andela, Google & Udacity Scholarship. I am interested in front-end development role and would be glad it provided opportunity to practically use my skills and knowledge to help the organisation meet it distinguished goals and target.

Software I use: Visual Studio Code, Photoshop, Corel Draw, After Effect (basic motion graphic), Office and more..

Looking up to hearing from you via email.

Thanks.
